# Proprioception

Simultaneous tactile stimulation of both a rubber hand (rubber hand illusion, RHI) in the field of vision, and the hidden, real hand evoke a sense of body belonging of the artificial hand in the subjects. In connection with this, another further phenomenon was observed: The subjects perceive the position of their hand as shifted towards the artificial hand, which describes proprioceptive drift.

The aim of this Master's project is to realise a similar experiment using Virtual Reality (VR).

The medium of VR has already been taken up in studies in the context of RHI and it was found that visuo-tactile stimulation can also induce a sense of belonging there. The implementation of the experiment in VR is commonly referred to as Virtual Hand Illusion (VHI).
